# Design Patterns Repository

This repository contains examples and implementations of various **design patterns** in software development. Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that arise during software design. They provide best practices and templates for writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

## Introduction
Design patterns are essential tools for software developers. They help in solving recurring design problems and improve code readability, reusability, and maintainability. This repository provides practical examples of design patterns implemented in [Programming Language, e.g., Python, Java, etc.].

---

## Design Patterns Covered
This repository includes examples of the following design patterns:

### Creational Patterns *unimplemented*
- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Builder**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.
- **Prototype**: Specifies the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance and creates new objects by copying this prototype.

### Structural Patterns *unimplemented*
- **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
- **Decorator**: Adds behavior to objects dynamically without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.
- **Proxy**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
- **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

### Behavioral Patterns
- **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes a request along a chain of handlers, where each handler either processes the request or passes it to the next handler in the chain.
- **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization, queuing, and logging of requests.
- **Iterator**: Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
- **Mediator**: Defines an object that centralizes communication between components, reducing dependencies between them.
- **Memento**: Captures and externalizes an object's internal state without violating encapsulation, allowing the object to be restored to this state later.
- **Observer**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **State**: Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes, appearing to change its class.
- **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable, allowing the algorithm to vary independently from clients.
- **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses, allowing subclasses to redefine certain steps without changing the algorithm's structure.
- **Visitor**: Separates an algorithm from the object structure it operates on, allowing new operations to be added without modifying the objects.

## Getting Started
To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/design-patterns.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Repository**:
   ```bash
   cd design-patterns
   ```

3. **Explore the Patterns**:
   Each design pattern is organized into its own folder. Navigate to the folder of the pattern you're interested in.

4. **Run the Examples**:
   Follow the instructions in each pattern's folder to run the example code.

## Usage
Each design pattern folder contains:
- A `README.md` file explaining the pattern.
- Example code demonstrating the pattern.
- Instructions for running the example.

To run an example:
1. Navigate to the pattern's folder.
2. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file.
